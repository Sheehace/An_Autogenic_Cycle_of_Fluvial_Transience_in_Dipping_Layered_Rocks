# An_Autogenic_Cycle_of_Fluvial_Transience_in_Dipping_Layered_Rocks

# This repository contains 3 folders preserving the data reported in the manuscript "An Autogenic Cycle of Fluvial Transience in Dipping, Layered Rocks".
# The folders are organized as such:

#   Landlab_Driver_Scripts:       Python driver scripts used for each of the 18 landscape evolution model runs
#   Matlab_MonteCarlo_Script:     Matlab driver script used for the Monte Carlo simulations assessing timescales of autogenic transience in the Blue Gate and Tununk Valleys
#   Data_Tables:                  Data entry and result tables providing context for Landlab_Driver_Scripts and Matlab_MonteCarlo_Script (these are also available in the Supporting Information file as Tables S1 and S2)
